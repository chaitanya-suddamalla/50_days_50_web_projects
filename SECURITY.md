- **Vulnerability type**: XSS, CSRF, injection, etc.
- **Impact assessment**: How the vulnerability could be exploited
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Suggested fix**: If you have recommendations
- **Your contact information**: For follow-up questions

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Contributors

### 🔐 For Project Development

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Use proper escaping for dynamic content
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for any external API calls
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and secure
- **Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive data

### 📝 Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- [ ] Proper input validation and sanitization
- [ ] No eval() or innerHTML with user input
- [ ] External links open in new tabs with rel="noopener"
- [ ] Form submissions are validated
- [ ] No sensitive data in localStorage without encryption

### 🚫 Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

```javascript
// ❌ Dangerous
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// ✅ Safe
element.textContent = userInput;
// or
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

#### Unsafe External Links

```html
<!-- ❌ Dangerous -->
<a href="https://external-site.com" target="_blank">Link</a>

<!-- ✅ Safe -->
<a href="https://external-site.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >Link</a
>
```

#### Hardcoded Secrets

```javascript
// ❌ Never do this
const API_KEY = "your-secret-api-key";

// ✅ Use environment variables
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;
```

## 🔍 Security Features

### 🌐 Main Website Security

- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented via meta tags
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All external resources use HTTPS
- **Safe External Links**: All external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
